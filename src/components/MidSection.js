China and the United States are primed to benefit the most from the coming AI boom, accounting for nearly 70% of the global impact.
AI art generators use machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks to generate art. Large sets of already-made art are used to teach these algorithms how to find patterns and styles that can be used to make new art.
